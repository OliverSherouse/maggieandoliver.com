# Ceremony

Details coming soon!

# Reception

More to come, but we’ll be holding an evening reception at Old Town Hall in Fairfax, Virginia.

# Hotels
[Coming Soon!] We’re likely going to recommend booking a hotel in the Tyson’s Corner area; it’s close drive to the venues, but it’s also on the Metro and a thirty-minute ride downtown to the monuments and museums.
