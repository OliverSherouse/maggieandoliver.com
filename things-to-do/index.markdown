# Things to do in Washington DC

This page will be updated throughout the spring, but initial recommendations include:

* Visiting the National Mall and walking around the Capitol, Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and more. This can be especially fun and breathtaking at night.
* The Smithsonian museums along the National Mall are free. In particular, we recommend the American History Museum and the National Art Gallery. For one a little off the beaten path, try the Renwick Gallery.
* Have kids? The National Zoo is free and you may even catch a glimpse of a panda or two.

Been there, done that? Hereâ€™s a few options for those who have done the tourist thing:

* Visit one of the many wineries or breweries in DC and Virginia, from Barrel Oak Winery with breaktaking views of rolling Virginia hills to Port City brewing in Alexandria. 
* Go for a hike! Check out Roosevelt Island and get an escape from the concrete jungle.
